Design report of CS564: PP3 Btree

Implement choice:
     1. How to keep track the path
               Using a pid array of size 10 to keep the path, starting from the root, to the node that may contains the key.
          A pointer to the last element of this array will be passed into insert functions and may perform the split or 
          possibly, recursively split.

     2. When unpin a page
               Most pages will be unpinned immediately after they are no longer needed. The only exception is the 
          currentPage, the page that may contain the next entry when searching. 
          
     3. Efficiency of the implementation
               To insert/search a key, the current implementation will transverse the tree up and down at most  twice.
               To find a insertion index in a node, the current complexity is O(logn)

     4. lowValInt & highValInt
               Current lowValInt/ highValInt is the value that is the closest number that is out of the search range. 
          For example, for seach query GTE 1 and LTE 10, lowValInt is 0 and highValInt is 11;

     5. add field size in leaf / non leaf node to keep track their size, the capacity of these node will be weakly reduced.

     6. test case
               Since the current structure can hold at most 697686 without splitting any non leaf node, three added test
          will insert 700000 entries into index in forward/backward/random order to test non leaf node splitting.	

     7. a list of all private method added
    /**
